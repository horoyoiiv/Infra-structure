# What is the difference between application server and web server.  


# 1. Web Server  

#### 1. WS is designed to server **HTTP Content**.  
#### 2. WS hanldes mainly **HTTP protocol**   
while application server can handle more than this protocol.  
#### 3. WS serves mainly **static contents** like HTML pages, files, images, video, and so on.  
 while application server serves **dynamic contents** which is generated by **business logic**.  
 
 

### 1.1. 
 * Apache Server  
 * Nginx  

### 1.2. Functions  

  1. If HTTP petitions are for static contents, then Web Server can handle this and respone the result immediately **without further request to WAS**.  
  2. If the requests are for dynamic contents, web server send the request to the Web Application Server.  
  and receive the result from WAS and send back to the client as response.  
  


# 2. Web Application Server  
   * WAS can serve the **dynamic contents** which require the **DB transaction** or **business logic**.  
   * It is also called as **Web Container** or **Servlet Container**.  
   * Container is for running JSP or Servlet.  
   * **That is, WAS as container provice the running environment for JSP, servlet**.  
   


### 2.1.
  * Apache Tomcat  
  
  

### 2.2. Software for Web Server and Applicaion Server

# 3. So why we need both of them

### 3.1. Web Server  

  * Static files like images, css and so on are not sent to the client with HTML file at the same time.  
  * When the client receives the HTML file, it requests the static files consequently one by one.  
  * So when the requests for static files come, Web server can handle these by itself.  
  It means the requests don't go deeper into the WAS, which means it can reduce the load of Web Application Server.  
  

### 3.2. Web Application Server  

  * Web pages don't consist of only static contents.  
  * To serve the dynamic contents, WAS can handle this kind of requests by accessing the DB and running the business logics.  
  
  
 ### 3.3. In a nutshell   
 ![스크린샷, 2020-03-29 18-31-46](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62331555/77845656-92a8a300-71eb-11ea-8455-9431828eedbb.png)  
 
   * WAS where the servlet-like containers are running is so busy. So Web server reduces the load of WAS by serving the static contents.  
   * Dynamic contents generated by WAS will be passed to web server and web server send this result to the client.
